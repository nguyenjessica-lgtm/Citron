# Called by build-citron-linux.sh's build_appimage_stage() after the install
# tree has been staged under build_dir/install-root.
# Can also be invoked directly if the install tree is already in place.
#
# Environment variables:
#   APP_VERSION   Version string embedded in artifact filenames (required)
#   ARCH          CPU architecture (default: uname -m)
#   ARCH_SUFFIX   Extra suffix appended to filenames (e.g. _v3)
#   DEVEL         Set to 'true' to rename app to "citron nightly" in AppImage
#   OUTPATH       Output directory for finished artifacts (default: $PWD/dist)
#   DESTDIR       Staging root prepended to /usr paths when locating the
#                 citron binary, desktop file, icon, and Qt translations
#                 (default: "" — real /usr, e.g. for an already-installed
#                 system citron). Set by build-citron-linux.sh's
#                 build_appimage_stage() to a build-tree staging directory so

# ── quick-sharun deployment flags ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# STRACE_MODE=0 — disable the dlopen / LD_DEBUG scan entirely.
#
#   In default mode (STRACE_MODE=1) quick-sharun spawns citron under
#   LD_DEBUG=libs for STRACE_TIME (default 5 s), then kills it, to capture
#   libs only dlopen'd at runtime.  When xvfb-run is NOT installed, citron
#   opens a real display window and the user must close it manually for the
#   build to continue.  Even with xvfb-run the scan is harmful for citron:
#   everything it captures is stuff we explicitly do NOT want bundled —
#   Vulkan ICD drivers (libvulkan_radeon.so, libvulkan_intel.so,
#   libLLVM.so.20.1 at 137 MB, …) loaded by vkCreateInstance(), the full
#   PipeWire SPA plugin tree loaded by PulseAudio's backend discovery, and
#   GTK accessibility modules from the GNOME a11y bus.  All of citron's
#   legitimate runtime deps are already covered by the static ldd scan
#   (explicit Qt plugins + libpulse + libgamemode).
export STRACE_MODE="${STRACE_MODE:-0}"
#
# DEPLOY_VULKAN=1 — stage libvulkan.so.1 (the loader) and its dependency
#   chain via the static ldd scan. This does NOT bundle GPU-vendor ICD
#   drivers (libvulkan_radeon.so, etc.) — those stay host-provided regardless
#   of this flag; SHARUN_ALLOW_SYS_VKICD=1 (set in .env below) makes sharun
#   prefer the host GPU ICD at runtime. On some Mesa/Vulkan builds, the
#   loader's own dependency chain has a hard DT_NEEDED on libLLVM*.so — see
#   the post-dep-scan cleanup guard below, which used to strip this
#   unconditionally and broke citron's ability to even start once this flag
#   was turned on.
#
# DEPLOY_OPENGL=0 — do not stage Mesa DRI or the OpenGL set.
#   libgbm.so, libdrm.so, libxcb-dri3.so, libxcb-glx.so are all DT_NEEDED of
#   citron / Qt plugins and are captured by ldd regardless of this flag.
export DEPLOY_VULKAN="${DEPLOY_VULKAN:-1}"
export DEPLOY_OPENGL="${DEPLOY_OPENGL:-0}"
#
# DEPLOY_PIPEWIRE=0 — suppress the PipeWire/SPA/ALSA plugin staging block.
#   On Ubuntu 24.04 PulseAudio is a PipeWire shim: ldd libpulse.so.0 shows
#   libpipewire-0.3.so.0.  quick-sharun's NEEDED_LIBS scan therefore sets
#   DEPLOY_PIPEWIRE=1, staging pipewire-0.3/* + spa-0.2/**/* + alsa-lib/
#   *pipewire* (~41 PipeWire plugins + 11 ALSA plugins + Bluetooth codecs).
#   These are backend-resolution plugins resolved from the HOST at runtime;
#   bundling them bloats the AppImage and causes host-version conflicts.
#   We carry libpulse.so.0 itself (passed explicitly below) — that is enough.
export DEPLOY_PIPEWIRE="${DEPLOY_PIPEWIRE:-0}"
#
# DEPLOY_GTK=0 — suppress GTK module / gvfs staging.
#   quick-sharun includes libqgtk3.so in the Qt plugin glob and runs ldd on
#   it; ldd sees libgtk-3.so.0, triggering DEPLOY_GTK=1 which stages
#   gtk-3.0/immodules/*, gvfs/libgvfscommon.so, and gio/modules/* (the full
#   GTK accessibility + filesystem integration stack).  quick-sharun already
#   sets QUICK_SHARUN_SKIP_DEPS_FOR="libqgtk3.so" so lib4bin skips transitive
#   deps of that plugin — but the DETECTION loop fires before SKIP applies and
#   sets DEPLOY_GTK=1 anyway.  The GTK platform theme should dlopen the HOST
#   GTK at runtime; bundling it causes version conflicts.
export DEPLOY_GTK="${DEPLOY_GTK:-0}"

# Tell quick-sharun to use CPM's Qt installation for plugins, not the SYSTEM
# Qt. Without this, quick-sharun defaults to $LIB_DIR/qt6/plugins (system Qt),
# whose shared libraries depend on the SYSTEM libQt6Core.so.6. That system
# version may be older than the CPM-built Qt 6.9.3 citron was compiled against,
# causing at AppImage runtime:
#   libQt6Core.so.6: version 'Qt_6.9' not found
#
# CITRON_QT_PATH = QT_TARGET_PATH from CMake = the Qt6 prefix directory (e.g.
# .../cpmcache/qt-bin/6.9.3/gcc_64). quick-sharun uses QT_LOCATION as the
# prefix and looks for plugins at $QT_LOCATION/plugins — that's exactly where
# aqt installs them.

# Fix for "libQt6Core.so.6: version 'Qt_6.9' not found" at AppImage runtime.
#
# Root cause: quick-sharun COPIES each CPM Qt plugin into AppDir/shared/lib/
# before running ldd on the copy.  The plugins carry a $ORIGIN-relative
# DT_RUNPATH (e.g. "$ORIGIN/../../../lib") that is correct when the plugin is
# in $QT_LOCATION/plugins/platforms/, but resolves to a nonsense path once
# $ORIGIN becomes AppDir/shared/lib/.  ldd then falls through to the system
# linker search path and resolves libQt6Core.so.6 to the SYSTEM Qt (e.g.
# Qt 6.4.2 on Ubuntu 24.04).  That system copy is staged into the AppImage as
# AppDir/shared/lib/libQt6Core.so.6.  At runtime the CPM Qt 6.9 plugins
# require the Qt_6.9 version symbol — absent from the system 6.4 core — and
# the AppImage aborts with the version error.
#
# Fix: prepend CPM Qt's lib dir to LD_LIBRARY_PATH before calling quick-sharun.
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH has higher priority than DT_RUNPATH, so every ldd invocation
# inside lib4bin now finds CPM libQt6Core.so.6 (and all other Qt libs)
# regardless of broken $ORIGIN resolution.  The citron binary itself is
# unaffected: it carries DT_RPATH (set by _patch_binary_rpaths via
# patchelf --force-rpath), which has higher priority than LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

# Qt's xcb-egl-integration / xcb-glx-integration platform plugins — real
# files shipped in Qt's official gcc_64 plugin distribution regardless of
# whether an app ever uses OpenGL, since Qt ships both the Vulkan-capable and
# OpenGL-capable window-system-integration paths as independently-loadable
# plugins. citron has no OpenGL renderer at all (confirmed: no
# renderer_opengl source tree, no OpenGL CMake target in video_core, Vulkan
# only) — so these two plugins are the only thing in this AppImage that ever
# has a reason to touch Mesa's OpenGL stack.
#
# Confirmed via the ldd-diag block's actual output (not a naming-convention
# guess this time, after two of those went wrong):
#   libvulkan.so.1 (the real Vulkan loader, what DEPLOY_VULKAN=1 exists for)
#       → libm.so.6, libc.so.6 only. Zero LLVM dependency of its own.
#   libgallium-*.so (Mesa's OpenGL driver backend)
#       → libLLVM.so.20.1. Nothing else in this bundled set touches it.
# So Gallium's presence, and libLLVM.so.20.1 with it, traces entirely back
# to these two Qt plugins — not to Vulkan/RADV as the original comment above
# assumed. Deleting the plugins is the actual root-cause fix; deleting
# Gallium/libLLVM.so.20.1 here too is redundant follow-through now that nothing
# else needs them, kept for the same "don't leave 100+ MB of dead weight
# lying around" reasons as the rest of this section.
#
# Caveat: this removes the plugin *files*, which is safe because Qt is
# designed to gracefully skip missing optional platform-integration plugins.
# It does NOT touch libLLVM-17.so.1 (dot-vs-hyphen: unrelated library, see
# above) or anything Vulkan/RADV actually uses. Still needs one more real
# Steam Deck confirmation before this is fully trusted — "citron never
# creates an OpenGL context" is inferred from the absence of renderer

# Write a portable qt.conf next to the real citron binary in shared/bin/.
#
# CPM Qt's libQt6Core.so.6 has a baked-in INSTALL_PREFIX of
# /home/<user>/cpmcache/qt-bin/6.9.x/gcc_64.  Without an explicit qt.conf,
# Qt uses that absolute prefix to locate its plugins and translations at
# runtime — which works on the build machine (the CPM directory exists on
# disk, outside the AppImage) but silently breaks on every other machine.
#
# Qt's qt.conf search is rooted at the running executable's own path, not at
# any library's location. sharun relocates the real citron binary to
# AppDir/shared/bin/citron (AppDir/bin/citron is a thin wrapper, not what
# Qt sees as its own executable at runtime) — so qt.conf has to live next to
